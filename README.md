# Block Plane Metric

Block Plane is a professional-grade sustainability tool that calculates the **Lifecycle Impact Score (LIS)** and **Regenerative Impact Score (RIS)** for building materials. It helps designers, builders, and architects make environmentally informed decisions by comparing embodied carbon, energy use, lifecycle durability, and cost-per-impact (CPI).

## 🌍 What It Does

- 📊 Calculates Embodied Energy & CO₂ Emissions (EII)
- 🧮 Generates Lifecycle Impact Scores (LIS)
- ♻️ Scores Regenerative Impact (RIS) with weighted sub-factors
- 📦 Compares materials side-by-side with impact + price
- 💡 Suggests alternative materials with lower footprint
- 📁 Exports reports (PDF, CSV) for permits and planning

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Lovable
- **Backend:** SupaStack
- **AI Integration:** ChatGPT + Claude (cross-checked calculations)
- **Deployment:** Netlify (target)

## 📐 Core Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **EII** | Embodied Energy + CO₂ |
| **LIS** | Lifecycle Impact Score (carbon, transport, construction, disposal) |
| **RIS** | Regenerative Impact Score (carbon, durability, health, circularity) |
| **CPI** | Cost per unit of impact |

## 📦 MVP Features

- Material database with lifecycle visualizations
- Horizontal bar charts (lifecycle phase breakdown)
- AI-powered takeaways & sustainability guidance
- Pricing visibility and Cost-Per-Impact (CPI)
- Beta-ready public-facing assistant (BlockPlane Navigator)

## 📈 Roadmap

- ✅ MVP Finalization (Q1 2025)
- 🧪 Beta Testing with Great Lakes builders
- 🌐 Public Launch (Phase 1: MI/MN/NY)
- 🔌 Revit Plugin (Internal Use)
- 🏗 Integration with Green Index and Lake Thread (Phase 2)
